# What is this?

**Site-Checker** is a very simple ruby script I whipped up to check a long list of old links to see which ones are still active.

I got the list from [an old](https://code.google.com/archive/p/pentest-bookmarks/wikis/BookmarksList.wiki) old repo I found on Google Code Archive. I will be using this script to to build a list of links for [another repo](https://github.com/benlights/netsec-cybersec-list) I will be creating to save all of the interesting and useful Network and Cyber security resources that I come across.


Feel free to send me a pull request if you want to add anything.
